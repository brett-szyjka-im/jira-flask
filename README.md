# flask-based web app for jira webhook infrastructure automation

## ci
- this app is set to deploy via CI to https://pythonjirahook.azurewebsites.net/ from the _main_ branch

## endpoints
- /api/health
	- healthcheck endpoint, returns string "healthy"
- /api/infrastructure-request
	- this endpoint is reached by the webhook installed on jira

## fields we care about (this'll be expanded after POC)
- issue id / issue key
  - this is important for auditability / context with the generated PR
- appname
  - this is used to construct the dynamic hostnames of machines generated by tf
- image / os selection
  - from dropdown, we can also decide which images we can automatically deploy and which are likely to require intervention
- cpus
  - self-explanatory
  - along with other quantitative 'spec' fields, we want to qualify these fields with limits
- ram
  - as above
- specified environments
  - checkboxes or similar for each environment (dev, qa, stage, prod, genesys)
- for each environment: number of servers
  - e.g. prod-4, stage-3
- networking information?
- role? (app vs web)
